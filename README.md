## Installing

- Install Git
- Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (or use homebrew/your package manager if you're on on Windows)
- `npm install -g truffle`
- Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/dualscyther/bootcamp-feb-2018-group6.git`
- Go to the repo `cd bootcamp-feb-2018-group6`
- `npm install`
- [Install metamask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Install Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache/)

### Running basic example

- If you have already installed metamask then disable it in your browser for now
- From inside the repo folder:
- `truffle develop`
- From within the truffle console:
- `compile`
- `migrate`
- In a different tab (while the truffle console is still running):
- `npm run start`

## Working with Truffle
